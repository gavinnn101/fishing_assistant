# READ THIS!!!
This is the original version of the dragonflight fishing bot found [here](https://github.com/gavinnn101/fishing_assistant_dragonflight). Click the link for the most recent version of the bot.

This was a private project for fun but I stopped running my bot farm and working on the project so I have no need to keep it private. I might offer minimal support and updates but don't expect any. The bot is fully functionable if you have a good bobber image and settings, my 6 accounts would run for 5+ days at a time typically but there is some instability. I will admit that a few of my accounts were banned after running 24/7 for 2 months straight on max pop realms. I fully believe the script is undetected if you bot reasonable hours to dodge in-game reports but of course, use at your own risk.


Discord: GaviNNN#3281 - If you want to pay me for features or support or to chat feel free but if you're asking for a ton of free support, I'll probably ignore you. Sorry, this project was never intended to be public.

# Introduction
Please read everything below even if you don't think it's important. You'll spend much less time reading it than I did writing it. Please follow the below sections in order CAREFULLY and let me know if you have any questions or run into any problems.


This is just a personal project that I'm developing for free in my spare time to use for myself and close family/friends. Please do not leak any of the files! I'm putting a lot of time into security and it all goes out the window if the bot files get flagged or a security feature is patched.


Bot Access / Invites:
Again, please do not leak the bot to anyone. If someone wants access to the bot, let me know. If it's someone I already know, they'll almost surely get access but I want to keep it under control. 


The goal of the project is to be able to bot at scale(2+) bots at a time with high level anti-ban, high up-time(designed to run 24/7 on virtual machines), easy monitoring and maintence of all bots via website, with as little human intervention as possible. 

# Features and Roadmap
If you think of any features you feel would be highly beneficial that aren't on either of these lists, feel free to let me know :)

🔴 - Not yet started / paused

🟠 - Started working on feature (will be one of the next features released)

🟡 - Feature implemented but little to no testing (use at own risk)

🟢 - Feature fully implemented and working

* Security:
* * Interception Driver 🟢 - The security largely comes from using the interception driver that scans for your real keyboard/mouse and fakes the input from there instead of virtual inputs that most bots use and are typically detected.
* * Randomized Bobber Click Location 🟠 - Click a random spot on the bobber to avoid pattern detection.
* * Code Obfuscation 🔴 - The code will by dynamically changed before each run to hopefully help against any signature checks
* * Breaks 🔴 - You will be able to set up break schedules for your bots so that they will log out after (ex: 30-45 minutes) for (ex: 5-15 minutes) and then after playing for 2 hours, break for 1 hour, etc. In my experience, playtime hasn't seemed to make much of a difference in bans for me but I do plan to implement it just incase. 
* * AI Generated Conversations 🔴 - I have access to OpenAI's GPT-3 which is an AI that can generate conversations/responses based on input. With this project largely being about running many(2+) bots at once, I plan to implement a feature where your bots will randomly have fake AI generated, WoW related(and other) conversations in guild chat or whispers to look less bot like. 
* * * 🔴 This same idea could be used to respond to random players that whisper your bot but I'm leaning towards just ignoring them. To be decided... Can always be optional


* Bot Management: 🟠
* * Users will be able to login to <gavinnn.com/bot> and control all of their bots from the webpanel. This way you can start/stop your bots from anywhere. 
* * * See screenshot from this other bot for a rough example: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julianperrott/WowClassicGrindBot/master/images/Screenshot.png
* * 🔴 Start and stop any of your bots at any time.
* * 🔴 See real-time stats for each individual bot (run time, gold earned, fish caught, etc)
* * 🔴 See real-time screenshots for each individual bot
* * 🔴 See real-time logs for each individual bot
* * 🔴 Send a message in-game as your bot character from the website (respond to whispers, guild chat, etc (to implement later)


* General Notable Features:
* * 🔴 Auto list fish auctions (I'm not sure how this could realistically be accomplished with this type of bot unless the user had a brutosaur.. I'll look into it but prob not)
* * 🔴 Accurate gold per hour earned (The only way I know how is the TSM API but it's currently unavailable. The price of fish will have to be hard-coded until then I think..)
* * 🟢 Automatically apply fishing bait every 30 minutes.
* * 🟢 automatically vendor trash items(bait/greys/etc)(provided you have a vendor mount like a mammoth).
* * * I've implented this with a combo of ingame vendor addons and a mammoth mount. You'll need to read the code and work it out yourself.
* * 🟡 Automatically relog into the game if disconnected and resume fishing.
* * 🟠 Feature Enhancement: Detect if it's reset day and sleep until servers are online.


# Installing Dependencies
* Installing Python:
* * Install the latest version of python 3.9.x at `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
* * * The first menu in the installer has a checkbox to `Add Python 3.9 to PATH`, make sure to check that box.
* `Shift+Right Click` in the `fishing_assistant` folder and click `Open Powershell here` and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Installing VBCable Audio Driver:
* * Open the `fishing_assistant/misc_files/VBCable/VBCABLE_Driver_Pack43.zip` and run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` and click the driver install button at the bottom right of the pop-up window.
* * If you need to download the audio driver for some reason(the same zip file above):
* * * Install https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm (todo: automate this? maybe it can be installed via cli?)
* Installing PyAudio:
* * It doesn't work if you try to install it through pip so you have to install the wheel manually.
* * I've included the .whl in the repo. In the same powershell window from above, enter: `pip install .\misc_files\PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`.
* * * It's worth noting that this file is specific to Python 3.9.

# Driver Notes
*  This is optional but should lead to a much lower chance of a ban. Set `use_driver = True` or `use_driver = False` to use virtual/pyautogui inputs.
*  * Virtual inputs aren't coded but can be easily added in place of the driver.
*  Open a terminal AS ADMIN in the interception installer location `fishing_assistant\Interception\command line installer` and run `.\install-interception.exe /install`. Must reboot the vm after.

# Settings
*  In-game sound settings should look like this: https://gyazo.com/34f574700038c463de102db9a25a21a9
* *  "Cable Input" selected
* *  Master Volume at 50%
* *  Sound set to "High"
* *  All other sound effects turned off
* `audio_threshold` in `fishing_main.py` can be changed if needed but should be good if volume settings are consistent.
* In-game Graphics settings should look like this: https://gyazo.com/1d640c0c65b37d0450890d6fcdd3d9b2
* * You can probably get away with different graphics settings but the main ones I would probably recommend are:
* * * Resolution: 1280x720 (Windowed mode)
* * * Resolution Scale: 1280x720 (100%)
* * * Preset Graphics Slider: Lowest / `1`
* * * Liquid Detail: Fair+ (I would not recommend setting it to `low`)

# Potential Issues
* Loud spikes of in-game noise may cause the bot to try and catch the bobber. I usually see this happen when I get a "friend has come online" popup.
* * You can fix this specific instance by turning off notifications in-game Settings -> Interface -> Social -> Turn off `Online Friends` and `Offline Friends`
* ~~Bot will see a high volume level left over from the last run and think there is a fish caught~~ fixed
